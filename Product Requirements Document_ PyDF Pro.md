### **2\. Goals & Objectives üéØ**

* **Primary Goal:** To provide a fast, reliable, and user-friendly tool for common PDF manipulation tasks.  
* **Business Objective:** Capture market share among users needing quick PDF edits without requiring expensive, full-featured PDF software. Maximize utility for developers and users comfortable with CLI for batch operations.  
* **User Objectives:**  
  * Quickly merge, split, rotate, and reorder PDF pages.  
  * Extract text and images from PDFs.  
  * Add basic watermarks and page numbers.  
  * Compress PDFs to reduce file size.  
  * Secure PDFs with passwords.

### **3\. Target Audience üßë‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíº**

### **6\. Success Metrics üìä**

* **SM-001: Number of Downloads/Installations:** (If distributed via PyPI or other package managers).  
* **SM-002: Active Users:** (Harder to track for a CLI tool, potentially via optional anonymous telemetry or community engagement).  
* **SM-003: Feature Usage Frequency:** (If telemetry is implemented).  
* **SM-004: Bug Report Rate:** Low number of critical bugs post-release.  
* **SM-005: Community Feedback & Reviews:** Positive reviews and active community discussion (e.g., GitHub issues, forums).

### **7\. Future Considerations / Potential Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è**

* **V1.1:**  
  * OCR capabilities for converting scanned PDFs/images to searchable text.  
  * More advanced annotation tools (highlighting, shapes).  
  * PDF to other formats (e.g., basic HTML, Markdown).  
* **V2.0:**  
  * Fully featured GUI if not in V1.  
  * Plugin architecture for extending functionality.  
  * Basic PDF form filling/creation.  
  * Digital Signatures.

### **8\. Assumptions & Dependencies**

* Users will have Python 3.x installed on their systems.  
* Development will rely on established Python libraries for PDF manipulation (e.g., PyPDF2, reportlab, fitz/PyMuPDF, pdfminer.six) to expedite development and ensure robustness.  
* For the CLI version, users are comfortable with basic command-line operations.
